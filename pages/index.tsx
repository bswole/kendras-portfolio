        Hey, I’m Kendra! I’m a UX Designer in Salt Lake City. I’ve always been creative and a problem solver, but also data driven and analytical. I love that UX allows me to put all of these skills and passions to use. I also have a deep drive to help others and spent many years in customer support roles empathizing with my users. I have experience in many different industries, including e-commerce, real estate, health & fitness, food service, and beauty & wellness.

        Some of the things I love are nature, fantasy books, my cats, cool tattoos, baking, iced coffee, and martial arts.
